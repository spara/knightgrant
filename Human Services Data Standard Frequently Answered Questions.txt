Model

In keeping with the goal of simplicity, there are only four primitive entities:

1. organization
2. location
3. service
4. metadata

Organization is the primary entity, location and service are subordinate entities and are children to organization. An organization may have one or more service(s) and an organization may have one or more location(s).

Each primitive has properties and some properties may contain multiple attributes. For example, the address property can include attributes of street address, city, state/province and postal code.

The fourth entity is metadata which provides provenence and verifiability of the data. Metadata provides the source and tracks changes to the data.
